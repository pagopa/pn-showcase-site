      "title": "What is a “legal” communication?",
      "description": "It means that the sending and receipt of these communications product legal effects, both for those who send them as well as those who receive them.

      "description_2": "First of all, SEND verifies if you entered the courtesy addresses in the “Your addresses” section or if you activated the “Digital notification” service on IO. If they are found, it sends a message to those channels to inform you that there is a notification for you.",

      "description_4": "If it is not able to reach you via the indicated digital addresses, it sends you the notification, together with the documents, via registered letter."
    },
    "4": {
      "title": "Is it already operational?",
